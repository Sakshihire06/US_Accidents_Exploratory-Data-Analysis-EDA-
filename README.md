# US_Accidents_Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
I am currently an Intern at Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0. As part of this project, I am analyzing the US Accidents dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors behind road accidents while building data analysis and visualization skills.  

**Project Goal**  
The aim of this project is to analyze a large dataset of US road accidents to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accident severity. Through in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project provides insights that can support road safety awareness and policy-making.The analysis leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to preprocess data, explore relationships, and visualize findings.  

  **Outcomes**  
1.Learn how to handle and preprocess real-world accident data.  
2.Explore accident frequency by time, location, weather, and road conditions.  
3.Visualize accident severity patterns using various plots and charts.  
4.Derive actionable insights to support road safety strategies.  
5.Document methodology, results, and interpretations in detail.  

**Datasets**  
US Accidents Dataset (Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents  
(Contains 4M+ accident records. Attributes include: time, location, severity, weather, road conditions, visibility, and more.)  
  
  **Modules Implemented**  
1.Dataset Acquisition and Exploration  
2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3.Univariate Analysis  
4.Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis  
5.Geospatial Analysis  
6.Insight Extraction & Hypothesis Testing  
7.Visualization & Interpretation  
8.Documentation & Presentation  

<p align="center">Project Workflow (Milestones)</p> 
<i><p align="center">Milestone 1  </p></i>  
Week 1: Project Initialization & Dataset Acquisition. Define objectives and expected outcomes. Download and explore dataset (shape, schema, stats, missing values).  
  
  Week 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing. Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Convert datetime formats and engineer features (Hour, Weekday, Month). Encode categorical variables as needed.  

<i><p align="center">Milestone 2  </p></i>  
Week 3: Univariate Analysis. Distribution of severity levels. Accident frequency by time of day, day of week, month. Weather and road condition analysis. Visuals: histograms, bar graphs, pie charts.  

Week 4: Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis.Correlation between severity and 1.Weather conditions, 2.Visibility, 3.Road surface condition, 4.Traffic congestion. Visuals: heatmaps, boxplots, pair plots.  

<i><p align="center">Milestone 3  </p></i> 
Week 5: Geospatial & Location-Based Analysis. Accident hotspots (latitude & longitude). State/city-based density maps. Highlight top 5 accident-prone states/cities.  
  
Week 6: Insight Extraction & Hypothesis Testing. Example questions:What time of day has the most accidents? Are accidents more severe during rain or fog? Does low visibility correlate with higher severity? Summarize findings with tested assumptions.  

<i><p align="center">Milestone 4  </p></i> 
Week 7: Final Visualization & Interpretation. Refine plots and summaries. Emphasize storytelling through visuals.  
Week 8: Documentation & Presentation. Compile methodology, insights, and conclusions. Prepare final presentation with charts and key takeaways.
